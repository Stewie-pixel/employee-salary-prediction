## Overview

This project builds an end-to-end salary prediction pipeline covering data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and deployment. Two models are trained and compared — Linear Regression as the baseline and XGBoost as the comparison model.


## Dataset

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Source | `data/employee_salary_dataset.csv` |
| Rows | 250,000 |
| Columns | 10 |
| Target | `salary` |

**Features:**

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `experience_years` | Numerical | Years of work experience |
| `education_level` | Categorical | High School / Bachelor / Master / PhD |
| `skills_count` | Numerical | Number of skills |

## Pipeline

The full pipeline is documented in `src/linear-regression/prediction.ipynb` across 9 sections:

1. **Import Libraries & Load Data** — load and inspect the dataset
2. **Data Overview & Initial Inspection** — shape, dtypes, missing values, duplicates
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — salary distribution, correlations, boxplots, scatter plots
4. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** — encoding, outlier removal via IQR
5. **Feature Engineering** — derived features to improve model performance
6. **Modelling** — train Linear Regression and XGBoost
7. **Evaluation** — MAE, RMSE, R², residuals, cross validation, error distribution
8. **Save Pipeline Artifacts** — export all models and encoders to `/models` as `.pkl` files

**Engineered Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `exp_per_skill` | Experience efficiency — years per skill |
| `cert_per_year` | Learning rate — certifications per year |
| `is_senior` | 1 if experience >= 10 years |
| `tech_role` | 1 if role is a technical position |
| `seniority_tier` | Junior / Mid / Senior / Lead / Principal |


## Models

### Linear Regression
Baseline model chosen for interpretability. Trained on all numeric features after preprocessing and feature engineering.

### XGBoost
Gradient boosting model trained on the same feature set as Linear Regression. Captures non-linear relationships that Linear Regression misses.

### Model Comparison

| Model | R² | MAE | RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | 0.4163 | $21,561 | $27,500 |
| XGBoost | 0.4454 | $20,856 | $26,804 |

XGBoost outperforms Linear Regression across all metrics by capturing non-linear salary patterns.


## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Docker Desktop

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
uv sync
```

**Run the model locally:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Run the full notebook:**

Open `src/linear-regression/prediction.ipynb` in VS Code with the Jupyter extension and run all cells via `Kernel → Restart & Run All`.


## Running with Docker

**Build the image:**
```bash
docker build -t employee-salary-prediction .
```

**Run with Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Run directly:**
```bash
docker run -v ./models:/app/models employee-salary-prediction
```

The `models/` directory is mounted as a volume so updated `.pkl` files are picked up without rebuilding the image.
